👋 Hi, I'm Manish Kumar—a Data Scientist (B.Tech CSE'25), passionate about Generative AI, Agentic AI, RAG, Computer Vision, and NLP. I build real-world ML and AI solutions to automate, analyze, and generate value from data. 

My journey is all about 'learning by building': from basic neural network on MNIST Dataset to Recognise digits to multimodal invoice automation and advanced document QA pipelines. 

🌟 Interests: Building with LLMs, LangChain, LangGraph, Gemini, Streamlit, Python, OCR, and Deep Learning.

Let's connect if you're building something meaningful! 🚀
